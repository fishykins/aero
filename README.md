A small exploration into various data structures within go. 

## Slotmaps
A simple implimentation of the Slotmap, which is essentially a fancy indexing system that prevents stale indices from being valid.

## Nesting (OWLS)
Building on Slotmaps, this is a relational tree structure that allows for quick and easy traversal between nodes (owls).
